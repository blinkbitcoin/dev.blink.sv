### Get the Wallet IDs and Check the Balances

Can run this query at any stage to confirm the change in the balances.<br />
The "BTC" wallet balance is denominated in satoshis.<br />
The "USD" wallet balance is in cents.

**The body of the GraphQL request**

```graphql
query Me {
  me {
    defaultAccount {
      wallets {
        id
        walletCurrency
        balance
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  <GetWalletDataUsd />

### Generate a New Address to Receive USD

Using Stablesats a merchant can generate and onchain address where the bitcoin received will be denominated in USD cents. <br />
Use the `address` from the response and send to it from any bitcoin wallet.<br />
The received satoshi amount will reflect the USD/BTC exchange rate at the time it was received and the balance will be kept at the dollar value.

**The body of the GraphQL request**

```graphql
mutation onChainAddressCreate($input: OnChainAddressCreateInput!) {
  onChainAddressCreate(input: $input) {
    address
    errors {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

  <OnChainAddressCreateUsd />

### Once Paid Check the Balance Again

The balance will be updated once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain.<br />
Until the confirmation the new incoming amount will show in the `pendingIncomingBalance` field.

:::tip
There are multiple ways to get notified on the incoming payments: see [how to use webhooks (callbacks)](webhooks.md) and [websocket subscriptions](websocket.md).

**The body of the GraphQL request to check the balance including pendingIncomingBalance**


```graphql
query Me {
  me {
    defaultAccount {
      wallets {
        walletCurrency
        balance
        pendingIncomingBalance
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  <GetBalanceWithPending />

</AuthProvider>

:::tip
To test the GraphQL requests further use the GraphQL playground at [api.blink.sv/graphql](https://api.blink.sv/graphql) for mainnet or [api.staging.blink.sv/graphql](https://api.staging.blink.sv/graphql) for staging.<br />
Check out the [Blink API Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29391384/2s9YCAQq3z#ed78e464-9874-4bf7-9b7b-92e5a898db83) to find examples in multiple programming languages.
