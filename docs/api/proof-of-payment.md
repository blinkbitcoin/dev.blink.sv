# Proof of Payment in Lightning
When using the Lightning Network the data is not recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, but still there is a cryptographic proof of payment consisting of:
* the **lightning invoice** - contents signed by the recipient node
* the **pre-image** - which the payer only receives when the invoice is paid.

See the Blink FAQ answers for more general details:
* [How to prove that a lightning invoice was paid?](https://faq.blink.sv/blink-and-other-wallets/how-to-prove-that-a-lightning-invoice-was-paid)
* [How to obtain a Proof of Payment from Blink?](https://faq.blink.sv/using-blink/how-to-obtain-a-proof-of-payment-from-blink)

## List Invoices with Proof of Payment
Requests the two most recent transactions paid via a lightning invoice (could settle over the lightning network or internally).

```graphql
query PaymentsWithProof($first: Int) {
  me {
    defaultAccount {
      transactions(first: $first) {
        edges {
          node {
            initiationVia {
              ... on InitiationViaLn {
                paymentRequest
                paymentHash
              }
            }
            settlementVia {
              ... on SettlementViaIntraLedger {
                preImage
              }
              ... on SettlementViaLn {
                preImage
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

## Verify the Proof of Payment
### Decode the Invoice
The invoice can be used to identify the destination node, obtain the payment hash and analyze other contents by decoding it for example in:
* [dev.blink.sv/decode](https://dev.blink.sv/decode) which uses the [bolt11 nodejs package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bolt11) in the browser
* using LND:
  ```bash
  $ lncli decodepayreq <invoice>
  ```
* or CLN
  ```bash
  $ lightning-cli decode <invoice>
  ```
### Verify the Pre-image
The payment hash is the sha256 hash of the binary form of the preimage which can be verified in:
* [dev.blink.sv/decode](https://dev.blink.sv/decode)

* or in linux terminal:
  ```bash
  $ echo -n '<preimage_in_hex>'| xxd -r -p | sha256sum
  ```

To use the preimage as a proof of payment the calculated hash must match the payment hash in the invoice.
